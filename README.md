## 🖼️  Image Compressor — A Simple and Reliable Photo Compression Tool

When building and optimizing websites, resizing and compressing images is often a necessary step.
So I created this lightweight and reliable web app for quick image compression — tailored to my own workflow.

This project also gave me the opportunity to practice:
	•	Designing an interactive and responsive UI
	•	Implementing light/dark theme toggle
	•	Integrating i18n using next-intl in a Next.js environment

📦 Compression powered by Compress.js
💡 Built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel
